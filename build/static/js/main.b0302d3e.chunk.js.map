In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device. Due to these results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive abilities. However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.\"\n\n\n    },\n];","import React from \"react\";\nimport {scp5Data} from '../../scp5'\n\nexport const Scp5 = () => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            {/*<br/> <h1>&nbsp; Title: SCP-002 - SCP Foundation </h1>*/}\n            <div className=\"container\">\n                {scp5Data.map((data, key) => {\n                    return (\n                        <div key={key}>\n                            <h1> Item #: {data.item} </h1> &nbsp;\n                            <h1> Object Class: {data.object_class} </h1> <br/>\n                            {/*<img src={data.img}  alt=\"img\"> </img> <br/>*/}\n                            <h1> Special Containment Procedures: </h1><br/> <p> {data.procedures}</p> <br/>\n                            <h1> Description: </h1> <br/> <p> {data.description} </p> <br/>\n                            <h1> Additional Notes: </h1> <br/> <p> {data.notes} </p> <br/>\n                            <h1> Appendix A: </h1> <br/> <p>  {data.appendix} </p>\n                        </div>\n                    );\n                })}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n","export const scp6Data = [\n    {\n        item: \"SCP-006\",\n        object_class: \"Safe\",\n        img: '/public/images/800px-SCP002.jpg',\n        procedures: \"Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons.
